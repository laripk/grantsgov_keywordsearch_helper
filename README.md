Grants.gov Keyword Search Helper
================================

It was brought to my attention by a good friend that the search facilities on Grants.gov are not so good. The keyword search always ORs your keywords together, even if you use AND or try to quote a phrase. On top of that it doesn't give the same count of results even if you run the exact same search 2 minutes apart.

So this is a little HTML scraper to suck down the results for a keyword search on Grants.gov into a CSV file.
